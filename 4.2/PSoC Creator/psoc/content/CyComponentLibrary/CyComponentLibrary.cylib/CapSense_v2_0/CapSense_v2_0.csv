AIirFilter,"Enables the Adaptive IIR filter. It is an IIR filter that changes 
its IIR coefficient according to the speed of finger movement. This is done to 
smooth the fast movement of the cursor and at the same time give fine control 
of cursor movement. The filter coefficients are automatically adjusted by the 
adaptive algorithm with speed of finger movement. If the finger moves slowly, 
the IIR coefficient is decreased; if the finger moves fast, the IIR coefficient 
is increased.",Widget Details tab
AverageFilter,Enables the finite-impulse response filter (no feedback) with 
equally weighted coefficients. It takes two of most recent samples and computes 
their average. Eliminates the periodic noise (e.g. noise from AC mains). ,Widget Details tab

between the two most recent values. If the most recent position value is greater 
than the previous one, the current position is decremented by 1; if it is less, 
the current position is incremented by 1. The filter is most effective at low noise. ",Widget Details tab

control of the pointer movement. In this case the IIR coefficient is decreased 
and filtering impacts less intensive on a position.",Widget Details tab
AIirPositionFastMoveTh,"Defines the position threshold above which a position

Edge correction, and improved accuracy as well.",Widget Details tab
CrossCouplingPosTh,"Defines cross coupling threshold. It is subtracted from 
sensor signals at centroid position calculation to improve the accuracy.
The threshold should be equal to a sensor signal when your finger is near the 
sensor, but not touching the sensor. This can be determined by slowly dragging 
your finger across the panel and finding the inflection point of the difference 
counts at the base of the curve. The difference value at this point should be 
the Cross-coupling threshold. ",Widget Details tab

with virtual sensors on the edges of a Touchpad. It improves accuracy of 
reported position on the edges. Two more parameters should be configured: 
Virtual sensor threshold and Penultimate threshold.",Widget Details tab
EdgeVirtualSensorTh,"Defines a virtual sensor signal. This value should be set 
to the value of any sensor when a middle-sized finger is placed directly over 
it. If this value is too high, a position is reported nearer the edge than ideal 
position. If this value is too low, a position is reported nearer the middle of 
touchpad.",Widget Details tab
EdgePenultimateTh,"Defines a threshold for determining arrival at edges. This 
value may have to be increased for small diamonds, so that the edge handling is 
initiated sooner. If this number is too high, there is jumping at the edge with 
a smaller finger. If this number is too low, there is jumping at the edge with a 
larger finger.",Widget Details tab
